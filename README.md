This is the repository which contains the code that was used to generate the results and figures for the manuscript "The pectoral axillary lobe - a new external immune organ in the zebrafish".

The contents of this respository are organized into into two individual folders: 
1. "Code" contains the R code used for QC, analysis, and visualization of our scRNA-seq data
2. "Markers" contains the differential expression markers spreadsheet
